# Party Pals

The goal is to transform event planning into a seamless and enjoyable experience for organizers, vendors, and guests alike. The platform is designed to cover all aspects of planning, from budgeting and scheduling to managing seating arrangements and coordinating with vendors, ensuring every detail is taken care of effortlessly.




## Features
- Seating Plan Arragement: We allow users to create their own seating plan by adding guests to each table. Our unique preview option lets users view their seating arrangement, providing a better understanding and ensuring optimal organization.

- Chat and Annoucements : The chat feature facilitates direct, one-on-one communication between hosts and vendors, empowering both parties to engage seamlessly and efficiently. We've added an Announcements feature for hosts to easily share important messages with all guests.

- Guests and Vendor Onboarding : We streamline vendor and guest onboarding by letting hosts add them to our database. We send invites through Gmail with unique login credentials. Once onboard, they get a role-specific dashboard view. Guests get an RSVP link to fill out necessary details. After confirming, they receive credentials to access features like announcements.
- Budget Manager : We enable hosts to log both paid and pending expenses to track their budget. The calculator shows the remaining budget, aiding in future planning. This feature is invaluable for providing a clear financial overview, preventing overspending, and supporting better decision-making during event planning.
- Gift Registry : The host can add their desired gifts which will be stored in the database. Guests can view and select a gift to give. Once a guest selects a gift, it will no longer be available for other guests to choose.
- Calander : The Calendar feature enables hosts to conveniently add and store important dates and events in one centralized location, helping them stay organized and informed.
